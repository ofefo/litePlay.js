litePlay.js
======

This repo contains the source files for litePlay.js, an experimental platform
for lite coding, is based on the following off-the-shelf technologies

- Csound
- JavaScript/Web Audio

There is no need to install anything, as the system is designed to be
served from online sources and runs inside your browser.

You can start by looking at the following sketches in the P5.js editor:

[Introducing litePlay.js](https://editor.p5js.org/vlazzarini/sketches/gSpXKc2sX)

[Sequencer example](https://editor.p5js.org/vlazzarini/sketches/c4PhzF39r)

LitePlay's [documentation](https://g-ubimus.github.io/litePlay.docs/) is
available both in English and Portuguese. This is a work-in-progress, which
aims to cover the complete system.

To use it in a web page, add this tag to the HTML page header:

```
<script  src="https://g-ubimus.github.io/litePlay.js/litePlay.constants.js"></script>
```

To play the default piano sound in litePlay, try: 
```
function f() {
	lp.play(C4); 
}

lpRun(f);
```
